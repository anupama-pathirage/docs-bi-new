# Content-Based Message Routing

## Overview

In this tutorial, you'll create a service that allows users to reserve appointments at various hospitals. Requests will be directed to the appropriate hospital based on the request payload's content.
To accomplish this, you’ll build a REST service with a single resource in WSO2 Integrator: BI extension. The resource will handle user requests, identify the hospital endpoint based on the hospital ID, forward the request to the specified hospital service to make the reservation, and return the reservation details.

Here’s an overview of the process flow.

1. Receive a request with a JSON payload similar to the following.

    ```json title="ReservationRequest.json"
    {
        "patient": {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "dob": "1940-03-19",
            "ssn": "234-23-525",
            "address": "California",
            "phone": "8770586755",
            "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
        },
        "doctor": "thomas collins",
        "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
        "hospital_id": "grandoak",
        "appointment_date": "2023-10-02"
    }
    ```
2. Extract the `hospital_id` field and select the corresponding hospital service endpoint.

    * grandoak -> `http://localhost:9090/grandoak/categories`
    * clemency -> `http://localhost:9090/clemency/categories`
    * pinevalley -> `http://localhost:9090/pinevalley/categories` 
   
3. Forward the request to the selected hospital service and retrieve the response which will be similar to the following.

    ```json title="ReservationResponse.json"
    {
       "appointmentNumber": 8,
       "doctor": {
           "name": "thomas collins",
           "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
           "category": "surgery",
           "availability": "9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
           "fee": 7000.0
       },
       "patientName": "John Doe",
       "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
       "confirmed": false,
       "appointmentDate": "2023-10-02"
    }

## Step 6: Add the routing logic

1. Click on the `categories/[string category]/reserve` resource to navigate to the resource implementation designer view.
2. Delete the default `Return` action from the resource.
3. Hover to the arrow after start and click the ➕ button to add a new action to the resource.
4. Select **Declare Variable** from the node panel on the left. This variable will be used to store the request payload for the hospital service.
5. Change the variable name to `hospitalRequset`, type as `json` and expression as below and click **Save**.
    ```ballerina
    {
        patient: reservation.patient.toJson(),
        doctor: reservation.doctor,
        hospital: reservation.hospital,
        appointment_date: reservation.appointment_date
    }
    ```
6. Add **If** from the node panel after `hospitalRequest` variable. Enter the conditions as **If** **Else If** blocks as below for each hospital.
    * grandOak -> `reservation.hospital_id == "grandoak"`
    * clemency -> `reservation.hospital_id == "clemency"`
    * pineValley -> `reservation.hospital_id == "pinevalley"`

    |Variable Type| `ReservationResponse`                 |
    |Resource Path| ```  string `/${category}/reserve` ``` |
    |message| `hospitalRequset`                     |

9. Click on the ➕ sign again and select **Return** from the node panel. Select the `oakEPResponse` variable from the dropdown and click **Save**.

    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/samples/message-routing/add-return.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/samples/message-routing/add-return.png" alt="Add Return" width="70%"></a>

10. The steps above will add the routing logic for the `grandoak` hospital. A variable named `oakEPResponse` will store the response from the `grandoak` hospital service. The response will be returned to the client.
11. Repeat the 7,8,9 steps for the `clemency` and `pinevalley` hospitals with the following configurations.
    
    **clemency:**

    |Field| Value                                  |
     |---|----------------------------------------|
    |Variable Name| `clemencyEPResponse`                   |
    |Variable Type| `ReserveResponse`                      |
    |Resource Path| ```  string `/${category}/reserve` ``` |
    |message| `hospitalRequset`                      |

    **pinevalley:**

    |Field| Value                  |
    |---|------------------------|
    |Variable Name| `pineValleyEPResponse` |
    |Variable Type| `ReserveResponse`      |
    |Resource Path| ```  string `/${category}/reserve` ``` |
    |message| `hospitalRequset`      |

12. For the else condition, click on the `If` condition `Else` path ➕ sign and add a **Return** from the node panel. Enter `http:NOT_FOUND` as the value and click **Save**.             
13. The final design will look like below.

## Step 7: Run the service

1. Start the backend service by executing the following command in a terminal.
    ```bash
    docker run --name hospital-backend -p 9090:9090 -d anuruddhal/kola-hospital-backend
    ```
2. Click on the **Run** on the run button in the top right corner to run the service.
3. The service will start and the service will be available at `http://localhost:8290/healthcare/categories/[category]/reserve`.
4. Click on the **Try it** button to open the embedded HTTP client.
5. Replace the **{category}** with `surgery` in the resource path and enter the following JSON payload in the request body and click on the ▶️ button to send the request.
    ```json
    {
      "patient":{
      "name": "John Doe",
      "dob": "1940-03-19",
      "ssn": "234-23-525",
      "address": "California",
      "phone": "8770586755",
      "email": "johndoe@gmail.com"
      },
    "doctor": "thomas collins",
    "hospital_id": "grandoak",
    "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
    "appointment_date": "2023-10-02"
    }
    ```
   <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/samples/message-routing/run.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/samples/message-routing/run.png" alt="Send Request" width="70%"></a>

6. The response will be similar to the following.
   ```json
   {
   "appointmentNumber": 1,
   "doctor": {
   "name": "thomas collins",
   "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
   "category": "surgery",
   "availability": "9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
   "fee": 7000.0
   },
   "patient": {
   "name": "John Doe",

   },
   "hospital": "grand oak community hospital",
   "confirmed": false,
   "appointmentDate": "2023-10-02"
   }
   ```
7. Optionally, you can test the service using curl command as below.
   ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8290/healthcare/categories/surgery/reserve" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "patient": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "dob": "1940-03-19",
    "ssn": "234-23-525",
    "address": "California",
    "phone": "8770586755",
